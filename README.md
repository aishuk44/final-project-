# Project Repository Overview
As a team, our overall goal was to analyze the three different satasets and find/determine what was the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on our individual findings. By using the three metrics of death, arrest, and education data we were able to discover that Shadyside is the best neighborhood when the sets are overlapped.
