    "For this project we were told to find the best neighborhood within Pittsburgh based on a metric that we had to choose on our own. Obviously there are several valid factors to determine this, but one factor that I felt would make it fairly easy to find this out was Educational Attainment. The dataset contained variables of the total number of people who have completed nursery school all the way to completing a doctorate degree and also the total popiulation of people wihtin that neighborhood. Using these statistics I was able to deduce the best neighborhood based on the highest category of education that was attained. Some alternatives I explored for this project were wage/salary pay per neighborhood and employment rates."

    "My metric, Educational Attainment, has variables that measured the total amount of people who completed different grades starting from nursery school to their doctorate degree. Towards the end the certain features I focused on were the new variable that was the sum of grades of people in highschool, those who have completed some college, and those who have attained an associate's degree or above. To find the best neighborhood, I calculated the percentage of the category/new variable associate column and this is where and how I based my overall conclusion of the best neighborhood. "

    "After analyzing the educational attainment dataset, I was able to find what represents the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. After sorting the data I specifically looked and calculated the percentage of those who earned an assiciate's degree or higher and based my conlcusions from these numbers. When looking at the listed out percentages in the table above, it is easy to assume that South Shore would represent as the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, although this is technically not the case. The total population of South Shore is 8 which means the percentage of those who attained an associates degree or higher is not the most reliable. When reanalyzing the percentages, but keeping the population in mind the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Shadyside. Once again the extremely high population foloowing a relatively high percentage shows that the neighborhood is the best because of its educational aspect. It can be assumed with this data that Shadyside most likely has more resources to focus on its neighborhood's education and prioritize those living in the neighborhood itself."
